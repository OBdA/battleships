This is a python implementation of the well known game "battleships".

This is my very first python program I ever wrote, something like my
"Meisterst√ºck". Since many years I wanted to learn python, because of
the very good (and very efficient) tools written in this programming
language.

In summer holidays this year, my family and I were at the northern sea
coast, we visit an old marine fort. It was called "Fort Kugelbake" and
is located near Cuxhaven. My seven years old son was very impressed and
after we returned to our holiday flat we played a round battleships the
first time.

He just learned the art of reading and writing last year, so he now
could find the coordinates "A6" or "I9" himself. (That's very critical,
because of the information hiding nature of "battleships").  We both
played this game until evening. In the late evening rose the thought of
a project I could realize to learn python.

There is it.
It's far away from being perfect or finished.
I tried, try and further will try to comment extensivly. Perhaps this
will lead somehow to learn python a little bit easier, too.

So, now enjoy playing "battleships" or reading the source, Luke!
